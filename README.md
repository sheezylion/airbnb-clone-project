# Project overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a hands-on, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project provides an in-depth exploration of full-stack development, focusing on key areas such as backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Project Goals:

- Collaborative Development: Master collaborative workflows using GitHub to simulate real-world team dynamics.

- Backend Architecture & Database Design: Deepen understanding of backend systems and relational database design.

- API Security: Implement advanced security practices to protect data and ensure secure transactions.

- CI/CD Pipelines: Learn to design and manage continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines for efficient deployment.

- Scalability: Build a scalable, feature-rich platform that simulates a booking system like Airbnb.

## Tech Stack:

- Django for backend development.

- MySQL for database management.

- GraphQL for API queries.

- Docker for containerization.

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

This project prepares learners to handle complex software projects by combining technical skill-building with team collaboration, security measures, and the integration of modern tools like Docker and CI/CD platforms. It's an excellent opportunity to gain experience with real-world technologies and workflows while developing a fully functional web application.
